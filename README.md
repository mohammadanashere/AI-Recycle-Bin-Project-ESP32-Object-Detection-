# AI Recycle Bin – ESP32 Object Detection (Work in Progress)

This is my ongoing project where I am building a smart AI-powered recycling system using **ESP32-CAM** and **TensorFlow Lite**.  
The system identifies **Paper, Plastic, and Metal** in real-time using a trained ML model and moves a servo motor to direct waste into the correct bin.

## Project Progress
- ✔ Model trained using Google Teachable Machine  
- ✔ ESP32-CAM setup completed  
- ✔ TFLite model tested successfully on device  
- ⏳ Hardware integration (servo motor) in progress  
- ⏳ Final mechanism under construction  

## Skills Used
- ESP32-CAM  
- TensorFlow Lite  
- Edge AI  
- Python basics  
- Embedded systems  
- ML model training  

## Note
The hardware part is still being assembled.  
Code, model files, and images will be uploaded as the project progresses.
